# labsTwo

Today we spoke about a numerous amount of subjects ,
namely the use of arithmetic operators .
Ive learnt more use of the increment and decrement operator.
The small detail that most would or could miss was the adding
the increment or decrement before or after the number to 
change the outcome based on if you are looking after or before the
number (--8) would return 7 in a console log but (8--) would return 
8 and then decrement the number to 7. After this the other thing I 
was not sure on was the for loop , ive personally touched on this but
today gave me a firmer understanding of this use of code.
Ive decided to change and try different alternatives to these 
examples and keep the understanding of this new found knowledge
stronger in my mind.


There is probably to many things to cover for labs two so i will shorten this one to simply speak about a couple of things , the first being the knowledge i have behind most of these operators and
 Equations is helpful in these learning situations but when you have to fine comb every detail its very hard to have polished off every combination , so I have learned so many new things but the top picks would be how if you are console logging with 0 || 1  , 0 will carry through until it hits what the code considers an apparent value because 0 is bypassed , obviously this wont be the best explanation for how it works but itâ€™s a way that I can remember the situation. I believe we go over every single option because again ive learnt a lot but you cant know everything and this is one of the ways we can try go over everything we know with that comb I was talking about. With the vast amount of specifics covered I feel keeping this journal simple is easier than talking about most other things in todays class , but on a final note the thing I really like is how many different ways and approaches people take to the equation for labs two , it gives me more ideas , makes me think about more possibilities and makes the task harder but easier at the same time.

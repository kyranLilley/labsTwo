//EXAMPLES:
//sum of cubes for 1, 5, 9 = 855
// Since 1^3 + 5^3 + 9^3 = 1 + 125 + 729 = 855


//setting each variable to a number.

//1 to the power of 3.
let onePower = Math.pow(1 , 3);
//5 to the power of 3.
let fivePower = Math.pow(5 , 3);
//9 to the power of 3.
let ninePower = Math.pow(9 , 3);
//this variable will be equal to the first two results + the last result.
let entireEquasion = (onePower + fivePower) + ninePower;
//the console log will return all of the values with a basic mathmatical equasion of just +'ing eachother.
console.log(entireEquasion);
